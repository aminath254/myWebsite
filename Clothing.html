The neckline is adorned with what is called kasabu viyun, a collar hand stitched with silver and gold laces.The image of traditional Maldivian women’s dress is carried in the heart of every islander, and normally in their pockets. The libaas lady in red, yellow, and black - cool, comfortable and confident. While libaas simply translates as ‘dress’, boavalhu libaas specifically describes a long-sleeved shirt with the wide neck, which is then often trimmed with the white and gold kasabu. The finished product is referred to as karufehi libaas, and is worn with an underskirt - feyli -  often patterned in black and white. </p>

This apparel is gown made with lace. It is elegant, made to fit the body contours well. The charm of the outfit lies in the elegance it reflects when it is worn. It is a lace creation, but with evolution, other textiles are also used. They are worn at important occasions such as formal and national functions. However, simpler versions of it are worn regularly by traditional ladies of the island. They are not as elaborate as the party Dhigu Hedhun outfits. They are worn along with minimal ornaments.</p>
