Delicately spiced with curry leaves and cardamon but with an added touch of fire from aromatic scotch bonnets. This is a great way to pep up chicken and tastes absolutely delicious. </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:darkseagreen">Mas Riha is a fish curry from Maldives, the small group of islands to the Southwest of the Indian subcontinent (it’s officially the smallest country in Asia). The dish is very representative of Maldivian cuisine, which is based on three main staples: fish, coconut, and starch. While many people associate curries with hot, humid weather, I prefer them in the cold of winter; to me, the contrast of bitter cold weather and tropical food tends to embolden the curry’s flavors. This week is our first real glimpse of winter on the East Coast (there’s snow on the ground as I type this), so it seems like the perfect time to share this recipe. Fish curry is just about perfect, since it needs so little time to cook; you can easily throw together this entire delicious meal in less than 30 minutes.</p>

    <p style=" color:darkseagreen;  font-size: 20px; "> Bajiya filling can be made differently. Some people use smoked tuna, some use boiled tuna, but I like smoked, dried and crushed tuna as this crushed fish give bajiya a traditional taste of "maskurolhi" (mixture of crushed dried fish, coconut, dried chillies, pepper and raw mango). Which every Maldivian loves to eat.</p>
