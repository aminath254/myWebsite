<h4>how its made</h4>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color:darkseagreen">Boats (dhonis ) are mostly contructed without the help of designs or plans which is quite facinating. It is made by highly skilled crafters in carpentaries by depending on the size, type and pliability of the wood for directions. The head of the carpentry would give intructions and measurements to the workers, this usually takes up to 60 days to finish. Boats are traditionally made from timbre, which was the only boat building material that was readily available. Sometimes the size of boat depends on the height and the avaibility of coconut timbres. back then. However, the timbre found in the Maldives is not the most ideal for boat building.</p>
<br>
<h4>Uses</h4>
<P  style="color: darkseagreen; font-size: 20px;" >Boats are known to be the oldest sea vessel and they have several purposes. The triangular shaped latin ring sails on the boat makes it alot easier for the boat to move forward because it catches the wind. They are mainly used for fishing but In the early days they were the main source used for transportion. People go from one island to another and instead of GPS and compasses the captains mostly relied on the labyrinths of corals and by looking the sky which helps them to understand the directions of north, east, south and west. This may take days, weeks and even months to reach the final destination depending on the distance.</P>
